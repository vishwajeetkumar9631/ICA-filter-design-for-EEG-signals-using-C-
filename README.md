# ICA-filter-design-for-EEG-signals-using-C-
this repository is for the ica implementation of the EEG signal using CPP.
Description:

Implemented Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in C++ for artifact removal and noise reduction in multi-channel EEG signals from the KaraOne dataset.

Designed a real-time ICA filtering pipeline optimized for computational efficiency and large EEG datasets.

Filtered EEG signals were prepared for downstream feature extraction and classification.

Ensured the design is extensible to Vitis AI, enabling future hardware-accelerated deployment on Xilinx FPGAs for faster inference.

Validated performance in removing ocular, muscular, and line-noise artifacts to enhance signal quality.![ica_CPP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/943feb99-5584-4caa-84ef-f1fc8fd56ee9)
